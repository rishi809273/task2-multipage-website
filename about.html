  <h2>About Us</h2>

  <p>
    We are a passionate and dedicated web development team focused on building
    clean, modern, and responsive websites. Our goal is to create user-friendly
    interfaces that provide a smooth and engaging user experience.
  </p>

  <p>
    During our Frontend & Full Stack Development internship, we work with core
    web technologies like <strong>HTML, CSS, and JavaScript</strong> to design
    professional multi-page websites that follow industry standards and best
    practices.

  <p>
    We believe in continuous learning, practical implementation, and improving
    our skills by working on real-world projects. This website is part of our
    internship tasks and demonstrates our ability to create structured layouts,
    responsive designs, and functional web pages.
